## About this Project
 ```My endeavour is about creating an application centred around the concept of TODO list that provides one of the best graphical user interfaces to captivate our visitors. Firstly, this application harnesses the power of one of the emerging frameworks which is Django because it provides a substantial amount of pre-built libraries or modules through which we can increase our productivity and quality over quantity. Also, it handles the authentication and authorization system as per the setup.. ```

```
This TODO list provides a tremendous amount of features that I believe, it attracts the user more often for never shifting to another application.
One of the best features that I like is dynamic background colours. You can set the background colour according to your own taste. 
You can add a description of your task for its details. 
Instead of deleting the whole task just to edit it, I have added an option of update task through which you can edit your task in just a click of a button.
You can prioritise your task and sort your list according to your priorities.
Wondering if you can see the task status of your list for example how many tasks are pending or completed and much more? I have added a feature of task status that gives you information about it..
